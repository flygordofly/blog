Project: 1 - record the rompus of my dogs and cats at night, via IR cameras in the house, with the goal of mapping which dog gets in the trash and which cat scratches the carpet and couches.  I want to map their activity or lack thereof after we go to bed at night.  The idea down the road for a prototype would be to build some device that alerts them to poor behavior like an indoor dog fence around things they are not supposed to get into - like trash. 

So... I've got a IR outdoor cam to use indoor - first things first - find out which dog is eating the trash and which cat is scratching the rug/furniture...
