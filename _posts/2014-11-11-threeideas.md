Three ideas for a project: 1 - record the rompus of my dogs and cats at night, via IR cameras in the house, with the goal of mapping which dog gets in the trash and which cat scratches the carpet and couches.  I want to map their activity or lack thereof after we go to bed at night.  The idea down the road for a prototype would be to build some device that alerts them to poor behavior like an indoor dog fence around things they are not supposed to get into - like trash.  2- second idea was to map my golf swing relative to a good golf swing to see finer points and 3 - the third idea was to map my son swimming using an underwater camera and see his stroke relative to a great swimmer like Michael Phelps.
